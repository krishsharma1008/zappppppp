## Earning XP

### Module Completion

The primary way to earn XP is by completing course modules. XP rewards are based on module difficulty:

| Difficulty | XP Reward | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Warmup** | 75 XP | Introductory modules, foundational concepts |
| **Core** | 125 XP | Standard modules, main learning content |
| **Challenge** | 175 XP | Advanced modules, complex problem-solving |

**Important Notes:**
- XP is awarded **only on first completion** of a module
- Re-attempting a module does not award additional XP
- All tests must pass to receive XP

### Daily Streaks

Maintain your learning momentum by claiming your daily streak:

- **Base Reward**: 120 XP
- **Streak Bonus**: +8 XP per consecutive day
- **Formula**: `XP = 120 + (streak_days × 8)`

**Examples:**
- Day 1: 120 + (1 × 8) = **128 XP**
- Day 5: 120 + (5 × 8) = **160 XP**
- Day 10: 120 + (10 × 8) = **200 XP**
- Day 30: 120 + (30 × 8) = **360 XP**

**Streak Rules:**
- Claim your streak once per day
- Streaks reset if you miss a day
- Claim before midnight to maintain your streak
- Streaks continue across course completions

### Course Completion
